# Hello!
Hi! I'm [Allan](https://github.com/acmlira) This repository compile all my knowledge about the **PIC16F628A controller**. I am graduating in computer engineering = I will **TRY** not to make mistakes :sweat_smile:

**Suggestions and bug fixes are welcome!**

### All information founded here has been taken from the [datasheet](https://github.com/acmlira/pic16f628a/blob/master/PIC16F628A.pdf) by [Microchip](https://www.microchip.com/).

# Goals
These are the life goals of this repository:
 - [x] Born (08/13/2018)
 - [x] Build a boilerplate
 - [ ] Build a bunch of example codes
 - [ ] Refactor and code improvements :triumph:
 - [ ] :skull: (sounds like deprecated)

# Like a boilerplate
I'm in **August / 2018** and this is my first repository in microcontrollers. You may have noticed that my files have specific characteristics, and they are:
 - **ASSEMBLY**
 - My *mnemonics, labels* and *functions* are written in **English**
 - But, the *comments*, they are written in **Brazilian Portuguese**
 - All sample code has explanations about *hardware behavior* in the [Wiki](https://github.com/acmlira/pic16f628a/wiki) (in **Brazilian Portuguese**)
 - All the sample code and especially the final design, has **circuit diagram**
 - Finally, if you try to replicate projects or logics in the real world, I'll make available the **.HEX files** if you want use that to *debug*
